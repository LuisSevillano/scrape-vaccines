## Health situation by country
Easy code to extract Spanish goverment recomendations about travelling abroad that contains info about language, vaccines, etc. that you need to know if you're planning to travel.  

Spanish Ministry Of Health doesn't have a way to extract the data with the information [web app](https://www.msssi.gob.es/profesionales/saludPaises.do). We asked them for a `csv` or any other format to obtain the information. However, they won't facilite any document as they told us that the information is already on the website. Then, I made this scrape.

### How
`npm install`   
`node index.js`

A `data` folder will appear on your repo with a tsv inside.
